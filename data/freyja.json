She was originally worshipped as a fertility goddess but in the Eddas she was often portrayed as a goddess of love, beauty and attraction. She was also associated with war, battle, death, wealth, magic and prophecies. Freyja was said to be the most beloved, honored, and renowned among goddesses. She is one of the most popular deities of Norse mythology.",
"detailed": "Freyr's name means 'the Lord', Freyja's name means 'the Lady'. The day of the week, Friday, is named either after her, or after Odin's wife Frigg. The Orion was called Frigg's distaff or Freyja's girdle. Frigg and Freyja may be one and the same goddess. Freyja is also widely known as Vanadis, which means Lady of the Vanir. The metallic element Vanadium was named after her. The Vanir are close relatives of elves. Freyr is the Lord of the elves, his sacred realm is Alfheim, home of the elves. Another well-known name of godddess Freyja is Gefn, which means 'Giver', a suitable name for the fertility goddess. Freyja represents the Norse women of Viking Age, whose husbands often went away to war. From Freyja's name, noble Norse women are called Fru, wives are called house-fru. And Frau means 'woman' in German. Freya and Freja are now common Scandinavian female names."
